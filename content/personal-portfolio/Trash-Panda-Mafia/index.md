# The Project
{{<youtubeLite id="-rd8wEKyuvE" label="Trash Panda Mafia demo">}}

Trash Panda Mafia is a 72 hour Jam game where you play a Trash Panda mafioso trying desperately to keep his mafia don fed and happy.  
Unfortunately, it looks like the enemy mafia is out to steal your dons food! You'll have to build up your own army of Raccoon mafiosos to defend the trash pile **or else**.

This game was a lot of fun to make. I handled gameplay and systems programming, as well as 3C programming and general game flow.

## Tools used  
**Game Engine**: Unreal Engine  
**Language**: **C++** systems and core gameplay systems, **Blueprint** for flow execution 
**VCS**: Perforce server running on a NAS
**CI/CD**: Teamcity for automatic builds and deployments to Itch during the development process

## My part  
For this project, we were a team of 5. We had a Blueprints Gameplay/UI programmer, 2 artists, an AI programmer, and me. 

My role for this project was 3Cs, as well as C++ Gameplay systems programming. I handled the following:
- Project setup (ci/cd and VCS included)
- Core gameplay loop systems (Game states, endgame scenarios, waves)
- Niagara particles
- Character health, combat, and states
- Summoning mechanics
- Enemy spawning 
- Balancing
- Level design 
- Shaders


## Learned experiences

Trash Panda Mafia was my first game jam project working with a team. I learned a lot about task delegation and the quick iteration of game jam projects, as well as how to communicate clearly with the team to ensure a singular vision which adheres to our core pillars is maintained. 

I also learned that grass is a good way to tank your performance.
